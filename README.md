Project Overview:

The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic dashboard that aggregates data from multiple tables and provides interactive visualizations. The dashboard allows users to filter data based on various criteria and view updated graphs and charts instantly.

Data Description:

The project utilizes three distinct tables:

1. Orders: Contains details about each coffee sale transaction.

2. Products: Contains information about the coffee products, including type and size.

3. Customers: Contains customer information, including loyalty card status and country.

Key Features:

  Total Sales Line Graph: Displays the trend of total sales over time.

  Timeline: Allows users to filter data by specific time periods.

  Slicers: Interactive filters for roast type, size, and loyalty card status.

  Country-wise Sales Bar Graph: Visualizes sales distribution across different countries.

  Top Customers Bar Graph: Highlights the top customers based on sales value.

Data Integration:

Using Excel functions such as XLOOKUP and INDEX, data from the Products and Customers tables are pulled into the Orders table to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. This ensures that all relevant information is available for generating accurate and meaningful visualizations.

Dashboard Features:

1. Interactive Filters: Slicers for roast type, size, and loyalty card status allow users to filter data easily. Any changes in these filters automatically update all graphs and charts on the dashboard.

2. Total Sales Line Graph: Shows the trend of total sales over the selected time period, helping to identify peaks and troughs in sales performance.

3. Country-wise Sales Bar Graph: Provides a visual comparison of sales across different countries, enabling the identification of key markets.

4. Top Customers Bar Graph: Lists the top customers based on sales volume, aiding in customer targeting and retention strategies.

5. Timeline: Allows users to filter sales data by specific month of the year or periods, offering flexibility in data analysis.

Conclusion:

This Excel dashboard project demonstrates the power of Excel in data analysis and visualization. By integrating data from multiple tables and creating interactive visualizations, the dashboard provides valuable insights into coffee sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. This project is an excellent example of how Excel can be used to create dynamic and interactive dashboards for business analysis.
